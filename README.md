# Random Python Scripts

This is a collection of some random Python scripts that I found on my laptop. (Not all of them, obviously, but a good collection of them!)

## Usage

Do **whatever** makes you happy with the code. Make a project, improve them, I don't care. Make something __**beautiful**__, a work of **art**.<br>
It's all up to you! ðŸ˜Š
